## Installation

Get the repository and run the following commands.

## Requirements

Minimum Conceptual Requirements:

- Include the product image, title, price, and link to the product page URL.
- Present a UI that is clean, visually interesting, intuitive, and efficient for the user to do the following:
  - add an item to a cart
  - remove an item from the list
  - sort items according to price, title, brand, availability

Code Requirements:

- Responsive : mobile first
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 / Sass

## My Approach

- FontAwesome for icons
- Bootstrap for CSS classes
- Kendo for components
- Box-shadow and scaling on hover

## My Approach

- A small gesture is displayed on running the application.
- The header is divided into 3 sections - Home, Shop & Cart. Clicking on each section navigates the page to that particular part of the page.
- Clicking on any image in the Shop section will display detailed information about the product with a link to Navigate to the Product.
- Adding/Removing an item from the Cart updates the number of items in the cart and the total amount which is displayed in the header.
