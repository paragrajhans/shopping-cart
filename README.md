## Installation

Get the repository (master branch) and run the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Requirements

Minimum Conceptual Requirements:

- Include the product image, title, price, and link to the product page URL.
- Present a UI that is clean, visually interesting, intuitive, and efficient for the user to do the following:
  - add an item to a cart
  - remove an item from the list
  - sort items according to price, title, brand, availability

Code Requirements:

- Responsive : mobile first
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 / Sass
- Accessibility Compliant

## My Approach

- The header is divided into 3 sections - Home, Shop & Cart. Clicking on each section navigates the page to that particular part of the page.
- A small gesture is displayed on refreshing the page.
- The landing page is a video.
- Clicking on any image in the Shop section will display detailed information about the product with a link to Navigate to the Product.
- Items can be sorted based on Availability, Stock, Title, Brand & Price.
- If the item is "Out of Stock", the "Add to Cart" button is disabled with a different color code.
- Adding/Removing an item from the Cart updates the number of items in the cart and the total amount which is displayed in the header.
- The footer has links to my github repository and email address.

I'm always open for suggestions and improvements.
