## Installation

Get the repository and run the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Requirements

Minimum Conceptual Requirements:

- Include the product image, title, price, and link to the product page URL.
- Present a UI that is clean, visually interesting, intuitive, and efficient for the user to do the following:
  - add an item to a cart
  - remove an item from the list
  - sort items according to price, title, brand, availability

Code Requirements:

- Responsive : mobile first
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 / Sass
- Accessibility Compliant

## My Approach

- FontAwesome for icons
- Bootstrap for CSS classes
- Kendo for components
- Box-shadow and scaling on hover

## Contributions

I'm always open for suggestions and improvements.
